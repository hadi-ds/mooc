#Empower EdX

This repository contains details of my work as a fellow at Data Science Insight which focuses on making a churn prediction framework to idensity student at risk in **massive open online courses** mooc. 

The data is resealsed I used is aggregated from a series of courses offered by Harvard and MIT on edX platform. 

The code and graphs are in IPython notebooks:
**DataPreparation** Contains data cleaning, adding new features to existing ones and some exploratory analysis and plots and prepares the data for modelling. 

**Learning** Here the churn predictor is built and applied to data.
