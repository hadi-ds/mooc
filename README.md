#Empower edX

This repository contains details of a data project I did during my fellowship at Insight Data Science. The goal is to make a churn prediction framework to identify students at risk in **massive open online courses** (mooc). 

The data I used is aggregated from a series of courses offered by Harvard and MIT on *edX* platform. The code and graphs are in two IPython notebooks:

**DataPreparation** does data cleaning, adding new features to existing ones and some exploratory analysis and prepares the data for modelling. 

**Learning** Here the churn predictor is built, applied to the cleaned data and is tested/validated.
